## What is Markdown?
Imagine you're writing a letter and you want some words to stand out. Maybe you want a title to be big and bold, or you want to emphasize certain words by making them italic. In the world of computers and the internet, we often need a way to style our text without using complicated tools or software.

That's where Markdown comes in!

## Why do we use Markdown?
Markdown is popular because it's simple and readable. Even without converting it to a styled format, you can understand the emphasis and structure. It's widely used for writing documentation, notes, and content for websites, especially by developers and writers.

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
In Markdown, the symbol used to create a heading is the hash (`#`). The number of hash symbols you use determines the level of the heading:

- `#` creates a level 1 heading (equivalent to an `<h1>` tag in HTML).
* `##` creates a level 2 heading (equivalent to an `<h2>` tag in HTML).
+ `###` creates a level 3 heading, and so on.

 >### How many do you need to create the largest heading?
To create the largest heading (equivalent to an `<h1>` tag in HTML), you need 1 hash symbol (`#`).
 >### How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
To create the smallest heading (equivalent to an `<h6>` tag in HTML), you need 6 hash symbols (`######`).

## Emphasizing Text in Markdown
In Markdown, both asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) can be used to make text bold or italicized. However, the commonly accepted best practice, especially for readability and consistency, is to use asterisks. Here's how:

- **Italic**: Wrap the text with one asterisk on each side.
  - Example: `*italic*` renders as *italic*.
- **Bold**: Wrap the text with two asterisks on each side.
  - Example: `**bold**` renders as **bold**.

## How do you create a link with Markdown?
To create a link in Markdown, use the following format:
  [Link Text](URL)

- `Link Text` is the clickable text you want to display.
- `URL` is the web address to which the link should point.

## What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
To create an unordered list in Markdown, you can use:

| No | Symbol   | Character |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 1  | Hyphen   | (`-`)     |
| 2  | Plus     | (`+`)     |
| 3  | Asterisk | (`*`)     |
